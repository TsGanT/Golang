# Enigma cipher machine emulator and breaker

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wb3u29ybxrzphl/Screenshot%202016-11-25%2015.34.47.png?dl=1)

This is a neat little emulator of various Enigma machines with a lot of
confugurable parameters. Somebody hurt your feelings by saying "my grandmother
encrypts better than you"? I've got you covered! With this port of the amazing
1940's technology you'll be just as good at encrypting things as anyone's
grandmother.

And I using the simulator and using brute force to break the cipher message encrypthed 
by this emulator. The algorith I used is Hillclimb.
You can find it in the pdf

### Usage

This repository contains both the CLI tool and its underlying library written in Go.
The library is documented on [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/emedvedev/enigma).

As for the CLI tool, a simple `go get` should do it:

```
go get github.com/emedvedev/enigma/cmd/enigma
```

While the full CLI syntax is a bit verbose, it's actually possible to use the tool
without any source code modifications, config files, or Enigma knowledge:

```
enigma Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down!
```

Using an Enigma machine with default settings is somewhat similar to
setting your password to `0000`. Let's up our security game:

```
enigma youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ --rotors Beta VI I III --reflector C-Thin --plugboard AD SF ET RY HK JL QZ WX UM OP --rings 10 5 16 10
```

Much better! And of course, `enigma -h` will give you the complete description of
parameters and usage.

Importantly, since Enigma machines only have 26 keys, spaces are replaced with `X`,
and everything outside of the English alphabet is discarded. It's up to you to
come up with a suitable encoding.

Enjoy!

## Enigma models and features

Almost everything from the German Enigma machines can be configured in this
emulator:

* Rotor set: rotors from M3 and M4, the most famous Enigma machines, are
  pre-loaded.

* Reflector: reflectors A, B, C (as well as thin B and C versions for M4) are
  supported.

* Plugboard: any number of letter pairs is accepted. Plugboard configuration
  is optional.

* Ring offsets and starting position of the rotors.

M3 and M4 can be fully emulated with the right parameters, and if it's
not enough, new rotors and reflectors can be added quite easily: just
add a new entry to the list in `rotors.go`, and that's it. Notches for
rotor turnover are optional.

Some exotic Enigma variants and implementations, as well
as devices such as Uhr, are not supported due to my chronic lack of
spare time. Your pull requests would be most welcome!
